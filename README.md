### Other accounts

DIME Analytics can provide general advice for
DIME repos hosted on other accounts.
For example accounts owned by external collaborators the project work with.
But since DIME Analytics do not have admin rights on those repos,
there are no specific guidelines for such repos.

### Why add DIME users as members first?

Users with an active contract with DIME ("_DIME users_")
should be added as members of
the https://github.com/dime-worldbank account ("_DIME account members_").
Adding DIME users as account members has these advantages:

* Project teams can give and revoke access to their repos when DIME users join or leave the team without having to involve DIME Analytics
* Collaboration across teams is easier as other DIME users can
quickly be given access to repos without having to involve DIME Analytics
* This provides a way to manage access to content
on the DIME account to DIME members only.

## DIME Account

These instructions applies to repos with URLs starting with:
https://github.com/dime-worldbank.

### DIME Account: Request membership

* **DIME users:** [Instructions and details](./instructions/dime-become-member.md).
* **External collaborators:** Typically only added directly to repos (see repo access below). See [instructions for DIME users](./instructions/dime-become-member.md) for a few exceptions.

**_Quick notes:_**
* DIME account membership allows the user to be added to GitHub teams - which means that the project teams can manage access without involving DIME Analytics
* Users with a contract mapped to DIME can be added as DIME account members.
* Becoming a DIME account member gives you access to many resources hosted on the DIME account, but to get access to project repos the user needs to be added to GitHub teams after becoming a member (see repo access below).

_See pages with instructions for more details._

### DIME Account: Repo access

* **DIME account members:** [Add DIME account member to team](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/dime-repo-access-member.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)
* **External collaborators:** [Request access to repo on behalf of external collaborator](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/dime-repo-access-external.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)

**_Quick notes:_**
* Users who already are members of the DIME account (see above how to become a member) are given access to the repo by adding them to the GitHub team used for that repo.
* The maintainer of the GitHub team can add DIME account members to the team without involving DIME Analytics. (DIME Analytics can help but will reach out to maintainer for approval.)
* To see who is maintainer of a GitHub team,
see the [team reports](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/tree/main/reports/team-reports).
To see what GitHub team is used for a repo,
see the [repo reports](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/tree/main/reports/repo-reports).
* External collaborators are not added to the DIME account and can therefore not be added to GitHub teams. Instead, external collaborators are added to individual repos.
* The request to add external collaborators to a repo should be sent to DIME Analytics by a person at DIME.

_See pages with instructions for more details._

### DIME Account: Repo creation

* [Repo creation instructions](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/dime-create-repo.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)

**_Quick notes:_**
* The request to create a new repo can be sent by anyone in DIME (does not need to be a member of the DIME account or even have a GitHub account)
* The request to create a new repo needs to be approved by a DIME manager

_See pages with instructions for more details._

## WB Account

These instructions applies to repos with URLs starting with:
https://github.com/worldbank.

### WB Account: Request membership

* **WB users:** [eServices request](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=wbg_sc_catalog&sys_id=910e1739db1a54903c5960ab13961912) (_WB intranet access only_)

**_Quick notes:_**
* Anyone with an active WB contract and a GitHub account can use the eServices request to join the WB account
* Joining the WB account do not by itself give access to any repo hosted there

_See pages with instructions for more details._

### WB Account: Repo access

* **WB account member:** [Add WB account member to team](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/wb-repo-access-member.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)
* **External collaborators:** [Request access to repo on behalf of external collaborator](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/wb-repo-access-external.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)

**_Quick notes:_**
* Similarly to the DIME account, WB account members are given access to repos through maintainers adding them to GitHub teams on the WB account.
* GitHub teams on the DIME account cannot be used for repos on the WB account
* DIME Analytics does not generate repo and team reports
(i.e. [these](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/tree/main/reports)) for the WB account.
Instead, browse this page https://github.com/orgs/worldbank/teams (_WB account member access only_) to find which team is used for which repo.
* External collaborators are not added to the DIME account and can therefore not be added to GitHub teams. Instead, external collaborators are added to individual repos.
* The request to add external collaborators to a repo should be sent to DIME Analytics by a person at DIME.

_See pages with instructions for more details._

### WB Account: Repo creation

* [Repo creation instructions](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/wb-create-repo.md). (_DIME account member access only - see [here](./resources/dime-only-resources.md) if link does not work_)

**_Quick notes:_**
* Most repos should be created on the DIME account, but reach out to DIME Analytics if you think your repo should be hosted on the WB account
* The request to create a new repo can be sent by anyone in DIME (does not need to be a member of the DIME account or even have a GitHub account)
* The request to create a new repo needs to be approved by a DIME manager
