# DIME GitHub Account Guidelines

#### Git/GitHub trainings resources

This repo includes instructions related to DIME's GitHub account.
For Git/GitHub trainings and DIME Analytics other
Git/GitHub resources see here see
[here](https://osf.io/e54gy/)
and/or [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).  

## Read first: Two different accounts - different instructions:

DIME repos are typically hosted on the DIME account:
https://github.com/dime-worldbank.
However, a few repos are hosted on the WB account:
https://github.com/worldbank.

Instructions are different depending on whether they
are for repos hosted on the DIME account,
or for repos hosted on the WB account.
Each instruction page will say at the top of it
whether it is for the DIME account or the WB account.
**You therefore need to first make sure that
you know which account your repo is hosted on.**

If your repo is hosted on the DIME account
the URL to your repo starts with
https://github.com/dime-worldbank/ and if it starts with
https://github.com/worldbank/ it is hosted on the WB account.
If it starts with something else,
it is not hosted on an account managed by DIME Analytics.

## General Instructions

**Skip to section:**
* [Repo access](#repo-access) - external or internal collaborators
* [Repo creation](#repo-creation)

#### Access to instructions for the GitHub accounts

Many resources and instructions linked to here are only available
with people already added as members to the DIME Account.
This applies to links that are followed by:
"_page only open to DIME account members_".
If you are added to the DIME account but
get a 404 error when clicking the link,
then make sure that you are logged in to GitHub.com
in the browser you are using.
If it says "_Sign up_"/"_Sign in_" at the top of the page,
then you are not logged in to any account in that browser.
If you still think something is wrong,
send an email to DIME Analytics with
your GitHub username and a link to page where
you see the link that gives a 404 error when you click it.

## Repo access

Read general access info and then
scroll down for links to specific instructions.

### Access for internal vs. external collaborators

**Internal collaborators are added as members of the DIME/WB account instead of directly to individual repos.**
As members of the account DIME users can be added to GitHub teams.
The GitHub teams are added to repos,
and everyone who is a member of a GitHub team used for a repo,
has access to that repo.
Someone from the project is made maintainer of the GitHub team,
such that they can give and revoke access to a repo
by adding and removing someone from the team,
without needing to ask DIME Analytics to help.
Read more about how DIME use GitHub teams
[here](../resources/why-use-teams.md).
For instructions on how to request , see links below in the
DIME or WB account section depending on where your repos is hosted.

**External collaborators can be added to one or several individual repos.**
This give them the same type of access as DIME members
for the specific repo they are added to.
However, they do not get access to shared resources hosted on the account.
For instructions, see links below in the
DIME or WB account section depending on where your repos is hosted.

[these instructions](#actions-for-the-dime-account) instead.

Anyone with an active WB contract can join the WB account by using this
[eServices request](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=wbg_sc_catalog&sys_id=910e1739db1a54903c5960ab13961912).
