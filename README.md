# DIME GitHub Account Guidelines

#### Git/GitHub trainings resources

This repo includes instructions related to DIME's GitHub account.
For Git/GitHub trainings and DIME Analytics other
Git/GitHub resources see here see

and/or [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).  

####  Skip to actions for the DIME Account:
These instructions applies to repos with URLs starting with:
https://github.com/dime-worldbank.
Read more about why we use multiple accounts [here](../resources/why-mutliple-accounts.md).

* Request to become DIME account member
  * [DIME user](#dime-become-internal-member)
  * External Collaborator - see DIME Member for exceptions
* Give user access to repo
  * [DIME account member](#dime-request-external-access)
  * [External collaborator](#dime-request-external-access)
* Repo creation

####  Skip to actions for the WB Account:
These instructions applies to repos with URLs starting with:
https://github.com/worldbank.
Read more about why we use multiple accounts [here](../resources/why-mutliple-accounts.md).

* Become member of the account
  * [WB user](#dime-become-internal-member)
* Give user access to repo
  * [WB account member](#dime-become-internal-member)
  * [External Collaborator](#dime-request-external-access)
* Repo creation
  * [DIME member - request new repo](#repo-creation)

#### Why add DIME users as members first?

Users with an active contract with DIME ("_DIME users_")
should be added as members of
the https://github.com/dime-worldbank account ("_DIME account members_").
Adding DIME users as account members has these advantages:

* Project teams can give and revoke access to their repos when DIME users join or leave the team without having to involve DIME Analytics
* Collaboration across teams is easier as other DIME users can
quickly be given access to repos without having to involve DIME Analytics
* This provides a way to manage access to content
on the DIME account to DIME members only.

## Resources DIME Account member access only

Many resources and instructions linked to here are only available
with people already added as members to the DIME Account.
This applies to links that are followed by:
"_DIME account member access only_".
If you are a member of the DIME account but
still get a 404 error when clicking a restricted access link,
then please follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you are logged in to GitHub.com in that browser.
If it says "_Sign up_"/"_Sign in_" at the top of the page,
then you are not logged in to any account in that browser
1.  Make sure you are logged in using the same account you used
when you requested to become a member of the DIME account
1. If you still think something is wrong,
send an email to DIME Analytics with
your GitHub username and a link to the page
that gives the 404 error.

## DIME Account

These instructions applies to repos with URLs starting with:
https://github.com/dime-worldbank

#### DIME Account: Request membership

* **DIME users:** [Instructions and details](../instructions/dime-become-member.md).
* **External collaborators:** Typically only added directly to repos (see repo access below). See [instructions for DIME users](../instructions/dime-become-member.md) for a few exceptions.

_Quick notes:_
* DIME account membership allows the user to be added to GitHub teams - which means that the project teams can manage access without involving DIME Analytics
* Users with a contract mapped to DIME can be added as DIME account members.
* Becoming a DIME account member gives you access to many resources hosted on the DIME account, but to get access to project repos the user needs to be added to GitHub teams after becoming a member (see repo access below).

See pages with instructions for more details.

#### DIME Account: Repo access

* **DIME users:** [Add account member to team](LINKLINK). (_DIME account member access only_)
* **External collaborators:**  [Request access to repo on behalf of external collaborator](LINKLINK). (_DIME account member access only_)

_Quick notes:_
* Users who already are members of the DIME account (see above how to become a member) are given access to the repo by adding them to the GitHub team used for that repo.
* The maintainer of the GitHub team can add DIME account members to the team without involving DIME Analytics. (DIME Analytics can help but will reach out to maintainer for approval.)
* To see who is maintainer of a GitHub team, see the team reports. To see what GitHub team is used for a repo, see the repo reports.
* External collaborators are not added to the DIME account and can therefore not be added to GitHub teams. Instead, external collaborators are added to individual repos.
* The request to add external collaborators to a repo should be sent to DIME Analytics by a person at DIME.

See pages with instructions for more details.

#### DIME Account: Repo creation

* [Repo creation instructions](LINKLINK). (_DIME account member access only_)

_Quick notes:_
* The request to create a new repo can be sent by anyone in DIME (does not need to be a member of the DIME account or even have a GitHub account)
* The request to create a new repo needs to be approved by a DIME manager

See pages with instructions for more details.

### Access for internal vs. external collaborators

**Internal collaborators are added as members of the DIME/WB account instead of directly to individual repos.**
As members of the account DIME users can be added to GitHub teams.
The GitHub teams are added to repos,
and everyone who is a member of a GitHub team used for a repo,
has access to that repo.
Someone from the project is made maintainer of the GitHub team,
such that they can give and revoke access to a repo
by adding and removing someone from the team,
without needing to ask DIME Analytics to help.
Read more about how DIME use GitHub teams
[here](../resources/why-use-teams.md).

if you are not sure which account your repo is hosted on.

**External collaborators can be added to one or several individual repos.**
This give them the same type of access as DIME members
for the specific repo they are added to.
However, they do not get access to shared resources hosted on the account.

[these instructions](#actions-for-the-dime-account) instead.

Anyone with an active WB contract can join the WB account by using this
