## Actions for the DIME account

These instructions only applies to repos hosted on the DIME account.
Most DIME repos are hosted on the DIME account but not all
([read more here](#why-does-dime-use-both-the-dime-account-and-the-wb-account)).
Your repo is hosted on the DIME account if it has `dime-worldbank` in its URL.
For example: https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin.
(If your repo says `worldbank` instead of `dime-worldbank` then use
[these instructions](#actions-for-the-wb-account) instead.

#### Request to join the DIME account

This request is open to you if you are mapped to any of the DIME units.
You may also use this request if you have a World Bank email,
have a DIME supervisor (even though you are not mapped to DIME), and
you work extensively on a DIME project that has a repo on the DIME account,
If you are not sure if this applies to you, then talk to your DIME supervisor.
If anything of this does not apply to you, then ask your DIME contact to request
[external collaborator access](#request-external-collaborator-access-to-a-repo-on-the-dime-account)
on your behalf.

If this request applies to you, then you find the instructions for this request
[here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin/blob/main/instructions/request-access-dime-org.md).
This page is open to anyone.

#### Request access to a specific repo once you are a member of the DIME account

On the DIME account we use GitHub teams to manage access to specific repos
for users who are added to the DIME account.
You can read about GitHub teams on the DIME account
[here](#why-are-github-teams-used-to-provide-access-to-repos).
DIME Analytics sets up these teams,
and assign someone from the team to be _team maintainer_.
From that point it is the team maintainer who adds and remove users
to and from that team in order to give and revoke access
to the repos that team is used for.

If you do not know which team is used for the repo you want access to,
then you can see reports for all repos on the DIME account
[here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/tree/main/reports/repo-reports).
In these reports you can see which team or teams are used to give access.
And from there you can click yourself to the report for that team
and see who is the team maintainer.
You can then reach out to that team maintainer and ask to be added to that team.


#### Request external collaborator access to a repo on the DIME account

If you are mapped to any of the DIME units you can request that
an external collaborator is invited to
one or several of your project team's repo.
This requires you sending an email with the terms and conditions
to the external collaborator, who then replies to that email to you
saying they accept the terms and conditions.
Then you forward that email to DIME Analytics who then
invite the external collaborator to that or those repos.

DIME Analytics pays a small fee for
each external collaborator added to private repos.
We therefore ask the DIME teams to only request access
for external collaborators who actually needs access to the repo.
We are not charged for external collaborators
that are only added to public repos.
We are never charged more than once per external collaborator
no matter how many private repos they are given access to.

The terms and conditions to send to the external collaborators
and more details about this request can be found
[here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/add-external-collaborator-dime-org.md).
This page is only visible to users currently logged in to GitHub.com
with a GitHub account already added to the DIME GitHub account.

the top of the page, then you are currently not signed to GitHub.com
with any account in the browser you are currently using.
Reach out to DIME Analytics if think you should be able to see it,
but are not able to do so.

#### Request a new repo to be created on the DIME account

If you are mapped to a DIME unit you can request that
a new repo is created for your team.
You find instructions for requesting the creation of a repo on the DIME account
[here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/request-new-repo-dime-org.md)

## Actions for the WB account

These instructions only applies to repos hosted on the WB account.
Your repo is hosted on the DIME account if it has `worldbank` in its URL.
For example: https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit.
(If your repo says `dime-worldbank` instead of `worldbank` then use
[these instructions](#actions-for-the-dime-account) instead.

Anyone with an active WB contract can join the WB account by using this
[eServices request](https://worldbankgroup.service-now.com/wbg?id=wbg_sc_catalog&sys_id=910e1739db1a54903c5960ab13961912).
This page is only visible if you have access to the WB intranet.

Requests for new repos and adding external collaborators to the repos hosted on the WB account can be found [here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin-private/blob/main/instructions/wb-github-account.md)

## Why does DIME use both the DIME account and the WB account?

Initially there was just the WB account (https://github.com/worldbank).
Eventually, DIME projects used almost half of the quota
of the WB account subscription,
making it difficult for other teams to use the WB account.
Therefore DIME Analytics ended up
creating its own account (https://github.com/dime-worldbank).

Today, most DIME repos has been moved to the DIME account,
and it should be the default location for all new repos.
Private repos should be created on the DIME account.
It is the least amount of work for everyone involved if public repos
are also created on the DIME account,
but if the team has a preference to create them on the WB account,
then that is a possibility.
The repos created on the WB account in the past that are still on that account,
are public repos for which the URL had already been widely published.
For example, repos with open source tools or reproducibility packages.

The one exception when private repos can be created on the WB account
is if the project is a collaboration with non-DIME WB teams.
DIME Analytics pays a small fee for each month for each user
on private repos on the DIME account.
In cases where there are about as many non-DIME WB users as DIME users,
then it is more appropriate that the repo
sits on the WB account using the WB subscription.
