## Why does DIME use both a DIME account and a WB account?

In the beginning there was just the WB account (https://github.com/worldbank).
Eventually, DIME projects used almost half of the quotas of the WB account subscription,
so DIME ended up creating its own account (https://github.com/dime-worldbank).
The default is that all private DIME repositories should be created at the DIME Account
but it is up to the team where a public repository should be created.
On one hand it is easier for teams to have both
private and public repositories on the same account
as managing user access is easier.
But on the other hand it is sometimes desirable to put public repositories
on the WB account as it gets more traffic.
A common way how DIME teams deal with this
is to use a private repository on the DIME account before publishing results,
and use a public repo on the WB account for replication packages
after the research is published.
But exactly how to do this is ultimately up to each team.
We can make exceptions and create private repos on the WB account if,
for example, the project is a collaboration with non-DIME WB teams.
You may invite external collaborators to repos hosted on the DIME Account.
However, DIME Analytics pays a small fee for each user
(including external collaborators) so we ask you to only request that for
non-DIME users that need active access to the repo.

## DIME GitHub Training Slides

Some of these slides are for trainings that are meant to be interactive and might therefore not be optimal for self learning. But we are still happy to share these slides and hope that you will find them useful. The source code for these slides can be found [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/tree/master/GitHub-trainings).

* [Intro to Git/GitHub - Contributor](https://osf.io/2mz4j/) - How to use GitHub to collaborate on code.
* [GitHub Team Maintainer Training](https://osf.io/arpyc/) - Intro to GitHub's Team feature that we use to allow the project teams to be able togrant and revoke access to the project teams' repositories.
