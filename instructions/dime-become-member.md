1. report to a DIME supervisor
1. work extensively on a DIME project that as a repo on the DIME GitHub account
1. have an active World Bank contract and an active World Bank email

If this does not apply to you, then ask your DIME contact to
request access as an external collaborator using
[instructions linked to here](../README.md#repo-access).
If you are not sure if this applies to you,
then talk to your DIME supervisor.
