# Request to be added to the DIME GitHub account

Instructions for how to join: https://github.com/dime-worldbank

This only applies to people with an active employment contract with DIME at the World Bank (although it includes anything from Staff, ETC, STC, to internship). If you work on a DIME project but do not have a contract with DIME, then ask your DIME contact to request that you are added as a external collaboator. You also need a World Bank email to be able to be added to the DIME GitHub account. If you are not eligible for being added to the DIME GitHub account, you can still request access to individual repositories, see the [main README](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin) of this repositories for more options.

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

You must first create a GitHub account. It is free and you can do it by following [these instructions and best practices](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Guides/Creating-GitHub-account.md).

### 2. Send email to the DIME GitHub Team

You must submit this MOU from your World Bank email, if you are still in the process of setting up your World Bank email you can not yet request access to the DIME Account.

See links on the [main README](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin) of this repositories for instructions.
