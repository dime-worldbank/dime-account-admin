# Request to be added to the DIME GitHub account

Instructions for how to join: https://github.com/dime-worldbank

This only applies to people with an active employment contract
with DIME at the World Bank
(although it includes anything from Staff, ETC, STC, to internship).
If you work on a DIME project but do not have a contract with DIME,
then ask your DIME contact to request that you are added as a external collaborator.
You also need a World Bank email to be able to be added to the DIME GitHub account.

If you are not mapped to a DIME unit but
still want to be added as a member to the DIME account,
instead of an external collaborator to specific DIME repos,
then see the section named _Adding non-DIME users as members_ below. If you are not eligible for being added to the DIME GitHub account,
you can still request access to individual repositories,
see the [main README](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin)
of this repositories for more options.


### 1. Create a GitHub Account

You must first create a GitHub account.
It is free and you can do it by following
[these instructions and best practices](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Guides/Creating-GitHub-account.md).

### 2. Send email to the DIME GitHub Team

You must submit this MOU from your World Bank email.
If you are still in the process of setting up your World Bank email,
then you can not yet request access to the DIME Account.
If you need access to the individual repositories in the meanwhile,
ask your team to submit a request for you to be added as an external collaborator.
See links on the [main README](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin)
of this repositories for instructions.

Complete the **World Bank GitHub.com MOU** below by
copying it to an email and filling in your information in the end of the MOU.
Send this email to  `dimeanalytics@worldbank.org` with the subject line
"Request to Join DIME GitHub Group - [YOUR NAME]".

### 3. Wait for the for DIME GitHub Team to invite you

When the we have received your request and checked that it is in order,
we will add you to the DIME GitHub account.
You will then get a notification from GitHub.com to your email
saying that you have been invited to the DIME GitHub account.
You can also go to https://github.com/dime-worldbank
and if you have a pending invitation,
a blue box will appear at the top of the page where you can accept the invitation.
These instructions will also be sent to you by email.

### 4. Make it public

Finally and optionally, if you want it to show on your profile page on GitHub
that you are a member of the DIME GitHub Group,
then go to https://github.com/orgs/dime-worldbank/people and search for your username,
and make sure that _Public_ is selected instead of _Private_.

## Adding non-DIME users as members

If you have a WB contract and UPI, then we can sometimes make an exception and
add you as a member to the DIME account anyways.
We only do this when, for example, you work on a lot of DIME repos,
or that you are really a full DIME team member but just hired or mapped to a different unit.
In either case, we need you to cc your DIME TTL/contact in the email where you request to be added,
and we also need you to include a short explanation for why
you want to be added as a member of the DIME account and not an external collaborator.

We do not make this exception for someone who does not have a WB contract or UPI.
Then the only way to be given access to a DIME repo
is by having your DIME colleague request that you
are added as an external collaborator to that repo.
See the [main README](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin).
