# Request to be added to the DIME GitHub account

Instructions for how to request to be added as a member of
DIME's GitHub account: https://github.com/dime-worldbank

This request is primarily for someone with an active
[World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org) contract who is mapped to
one of the [DIME](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) units.
If this does not apply to you, then ask your DIME contact to
request access as an external collaborator using
[instructions linked to here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin/blob/main/README.md).

One exception for when you can still request to be added to the DIME account
despite not being mapped to DIME is if you:
1. Report to a DIME supervisor
1. Work extensively on a DIME project that as a repo on the DIME GitHub account
1. Have an active World Bank contract and an active World Bank email

If you are not sure if this applies to you, then talk to your DIME supervisor.
If this does not apply to you, then ask your DIME contact to
request access as an external collaborator using
[instructions linked to here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin/blob/main/README.md).

If you are eligible to request to be added to the DIME GitHub account,
then follow the 5 steps below.

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

you must first create a GitHub account.

or to learn about recommended settings for new or existing accounts,
use [these instructions and best practices](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Guides/Creating-GitHub-account.md).

### 2. Send email to the DIME GitHub Team

If you are still in the process of setting up your World Bank email,

ask your team to request access as an external collaborator using
[instructions linked to here](https://github.com/dime-worldbank/dime-account-admin/blob/main/README.md).

This final step is optional but highly encouraged.

If you want it to show on your profile page on GitHub
that you are a member of the DIME GitHub Group,
then you need to set your self as a public member of the account.
To make your self a public member of the DIME account,
go to https://github.com/orgs/dime-worldbank/people
and search for your username.
Make sure that _Public_ is selected instead of _Private_.
Once this is done, other users on GitHub.com can see on your profile page
that you are a member of DIME's GitHub account.
