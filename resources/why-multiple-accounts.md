## Which account is your repo hosted on?

Before submitting any request,
make sure you know which account your repo is hosted on.

DIME repos are typically hosted on the DIME account:
https://github.com/dime-worldbank.
However, a few repos are hosted on the WB account:
https://github.com/worldbank.
Instructions are different depending on which
account your repo is hosted on.
The instructions will say which account they are for.

If your repo is hosted on the DIME account
the URL to your repo starts with
https://github.com/dime-worldbank/ and if it starts with
https://github.com/worldbank/ it is hosted on the WB account.
If it starts with something else,
it is not hosted on an account managed by DIME Analytics.


## Why does DIME use both the DIME account and the WB account?

Initially there was just the WB account (https://github.com/worldbank).
Eventually, DIME projects used almost half of the quota
of the WB account subscription,
making it difficult for other teams to use the WB account.
Therefore DIME Analytics ended up
creating its own account (https://github.com/dime-worldbank).

Today, most DIME repos has been moved to the DIME account,
and it should be the default location for all new repos.
Private repos should be created on the DIME account.
It is the least amount of work for everyone involved if public repos
are also created on the DIME account,
but if the team has a preference to create them on the WB account,
then that is a possibility.
The repos created on the WB account in the past that are still on that account,
are public repos for which the URL had already been widely published.
For example, repos with open source tools or reproducibility packages.

The one exception when private repos can be created on the WB account
is if the project is a collaboration with non-DIME WB teams.
DIME Analytics pays a small fee for each month for each user
on private repos on the DIME account.
In cases where there are about as many non-DIME WB users as DIME users,
then it is more appropriate that the repo
sits on the WB account using the WB subscription.
