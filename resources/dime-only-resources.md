## Resources DIME Account member access only

Some resources and instructions on the DIME GitHub account are
only visible to members of the DIME Account.
Links to such resources are marked with:
"_DIME account member access only_".

If you are a member of the DIME account but
still get a 404 error when clicking such a ling,
then please follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you are logged in to GitHub.com in that browser.
If it says "_Sign up_"/"_Sign in_" at the top of the page,
then you are not logged in to any account in that browser

1.  Make sure you are logged in using the same account you used
when you requested to become a member of the DIME account.
To see what account you are currently logged in with,
click your profile picture at the top-right of any page on https://github.com/,
then select "_Your profile_".
That will bring you to a page that
has a URL on the format `https://github.com/<username>`,
where `<username>` corresponds to the username you are currently logged in as.

1. If you are not sure what account you used when you requested access
to become a member of the DIME account, then reach out to DIME Analytics to ask.

If you have followed the steps above but cannot access a link, 
please send an email to DIME Analytics.
Please include your GitHub username  and a link to the page
that gives the 404 error.
